Maddy,
why did we bake those pies?
We could have bought them,
and probably saved some time.
But we made them,
yeah we made those pies.
You almost cried,
but I didn't see you cry.

Maddy,
do you even like them?
I guess someone liked it,
for the best taste award bit.
What kind of person makes a hundred pies?
And it doesn't even break their stride.
Maddy there were fears there,
if we failed would you even care?
